# FK-Shid

Cookie Consent is widely adopted and Google has killed 3rd party cookies. So tracking is dead? Nah it's just smarter and sneakier now. 

## Description

To get around this, a lot of sites are now tracking users with query strings in the URL to tell the server processing the request some interesting tracking information about you. Hopefully the Regex patterns and utilities will help to strip those out.

Will this work forever? Likely not, TikTok as an example appears to obfuscate their actual video resources behind a generated UUID that regenerates every time, this approach can never protect against that sort of tracking approach. If other providers start doing this then they'll also become difficult to prevent tracking.

## Getting Started

TODO: Will fill this in later.
